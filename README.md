# Workshop 1
**Goals**: Learning how to code, how the functions work through working with different shapes that is presented on the reference page on P5.JS. 
Learning how to code with P5.JS to creat a piece of art. P5.js is a tool used by Javascript the computer language to draw different types of visual artwork. 
There is already two functions that is presented. Function set up and function draw. The Function set up is the area that is allowed for the art to be presented for example the background in grey colour. Whereas the function draw is the space for drawing to happen.

Draw function also allows different colours and shapes to be used.

Circle () and ellipse() were the shape i have chosen to draw. 
Ecclipse blue colour  fill(0,255,255)
Yellow circle fill(255,255,0)
white stroke() outside line of the yellow circle stroke(255)
Blue stroke() outside line of the blue oval stroke(0,0,250)
If wanting the art work to show any movement then we need to use the if statement to determine if the variable is true. In this case if the x is greater then the width then there will be an effect showing on the diagram. In this case the yellow circle is moving throught he blue ecclipse that means that is true but if its not then the circle wont show any movements.

**What can I do differently?** Learning more of what to do inorder for the circle to go backwards, In this case may trying to minus from 0 so that the yellow circle can bounce back when reach the the other edge. 
**Source where you get the information?** From the reference page on P5.JS and also Chat Gpt. 
Needing to know what I need to include in these notes I had to do a search on Chat Gpt.

Also through the work shop videos I was able to log in to GitHub and P5.JS this resource helped me understand how this coding works but still early learning. 
**Recommended for Beginners. **
